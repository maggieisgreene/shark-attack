# Shark Attack

## Description
This application has all of E10's students out for a beach day, but hungry sharks have infested the pool. Clicking the `Shark Attack` button selects a student at random, and well, kills them. They are then moved to the Graveyard â€” sadly, there are no lifegaurds around at this time.

## Technologies Used
 ReactJS | SASS | JSX | Bootstrap
